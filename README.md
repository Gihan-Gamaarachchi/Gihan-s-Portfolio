Welcome to my data portfolio! Here, I document a summary of my projects in the data field.

## SQL Projects

| Project | Description of Analysis |
|---------|-------------------------|
| [UK Accident Data](https://github.com/Gihan-Gamaarachchi/UK-Accident-Data/blob/main/README.md) | I employed SQL to clean and analyse UK accident data, unraveling key insights into geographical hotspots, prevalent vehicle types, and temporal trends. Through targeted queries, I uncovered patterns, identified accident-prone regions, and assessed the impact of vehicle types, offering valuable perspectives for road safety initiatives. This project showcases my adeptness in data cleaning, SQL analysis, and the ability to distill complex datasets into actionable insights for informed decision-making.|
